# Universal Skin Detection Without Color Information

This project implements the algorithm proposed in *Universal Skin Detection Without Color Information* (WACV 2017), which detects human skin in grayscale images using facial priors and texture-based features, without relying on color.

# üìë Features
- Custom dataset derived from the HELEN dataset.
- Skin region identification using:
  - Face-based intensity priors.
  - Distance-based facial landmarks.
  - Local Binary Patterns (LBP), lacunarity, and grayscale statistics.
- Region growing algorithm for full skin segmentation.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Run Locally
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icingtea/skin_detection.git
cd skin_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run `main.ipynb`
